<h1>Vulnerability Scanning With Nmap</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project consists of installing and verifying current version of Nmap, running both a basic and aggressive scan while also searching the network for any potential vulnerabilities.</p>



<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Linux Terminal</b> 
- <b>Nmap</b>
  
<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b> Ubuntu</b> 

<h2>Objectives:</h2>

- <b>Install and verify Nmap installation</b> 
- <b>Access help feature and Man page</b> 
- <b>Run a basic Nmap scan on target network</b> 
- <b>Run a basic Nmap scan with /30 CIDR notation</b>
- <b>Run an aggressive Nmap scan with options on target network</b>
- <b>Discover possible vulnerabilities on the target network</b> 
- <b>Suggest ways to mitigate the vulnerabilities that were discovered</b>

<br />
<br />
  Now, let's scan for more hosts against the target with a /30 CIDR notation:  <br/>

<br />
Finally, let's run an aggressive scan with options!:  <br/>

<h2>Findings:</h2>

- <b> After Installing Nmap I verified that I was currently running Nmap version 7.60.</b>
- <b> Accesssing the help/man page can assist you in locating proper key commands and finding out how to scan for specific output.</b>
- <b> -T allows for faster execution of the scan.</b>
- <b> -A enables OS and version detection, script scanning and traceroute information to be displayed in the output of the scan.</b>
- <b> Aggressive scans can generate more network traffic but they also typically consume more system resources from the scanning machine or even the target network so there is the possiblility of throwing the host offline 
      or causing a crash.</b>
- <b> Running an aggressive scan with options can help you customize and optimize scan results in a more accurate and timely fashion.</b> 
- <b> Found port 80 to be open on both our basic and aggressive scans. This has indicated the network may be vulnerable to SQL injection, cross-site-scripting, remote code execution and dos attacks. Following secure web 
      development practices and regularly updating the apache server can help minimize these risks.</b> 
- <b> When running the aggressive scan I found port 22 to be open and running openSSH. While SSH is generally secure, the presence of this open port can expose the system to brute force attacks or the exploitation of 
      openSSH itself if there are any known vulnerabilities for this particular version. Disabling root login and ensuring strong authentication methods could help mitigate this vulnerability.</b>
- <b> Found port 9929 to be open indicating it could be vulnerable to potential information disclosure or a dos attack. Restricting access to trusted hosts and disabling the nping echo service if it is not currently in 
      use could be useful mitigation techniques for this issue.</b>
- <b> Finally, I found port 31337 to be open. Despite this port having a tcp wrapper, it can still be bypassed. In order to mitigate potential risks we can ensure we have proper firewall rules put into place and that the 
      port is continuously monitored for suspicious activity.</b>
