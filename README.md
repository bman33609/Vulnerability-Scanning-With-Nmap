<h2>Findings:</h2>

- <b> After Installing Nmap I verified that I was currently running Nmap version 7.60.</b>
- <b> Acesssing the help/man page can assist you in locating proper key commands and finding out how to scan for specific output.</b>
- <b> -A enables OS and version detection, script scanning and traceroute information to be displayed in the output of the scan.</b>
- <b> -T allows for faster execution of the scan.</b>
- <b> Running an aggressive scan with options can help you customize and optimize scan results in a more accurate and timely fashion.</b> 
- <b> Found port 80 to be open during the basic network scan which would indicate the network may be vulnerable to SQL injection, cross-site-scripting, cross-site-request-forgery and Ddos attacks.</b>
