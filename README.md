<h2>Findings:</h2>

- <b> After Installing Nmap I verified that I was currently running Nmap version 7.60.</b> 
- <b> Running an aggressive scan with options can helps you customize and optimize scan results in a more accurate and timely fashion.</b> 
- <b> Found port 80 to be open which would indicate the network may be vulnerable to SQL injection or Dos attacks.</b>
